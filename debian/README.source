.symbols file
-------------

Recent versions of telepathy-glib (>= 0.7.10) generate a sample version of the
file libtelepathy-glib0.symbols at build time. This is not automatically used
for anything, but it's a convenient way to update the Debian packaging for
new symbols.

When packaging new upstream releases, you can update the version
that's actually used to build the package by copying it from
telepathy-glib/_gen/ into the debian/ directory.
