Description: Telepathy framework - GLib connection manager library
 This package contains telepathy-glib, a GLib-based library for Telepathy
 components.
 .
 Telepathy is a D-Bus framework for unifying real time communication,
 including instant messaging, voice calls and video calls. It abstracts
 differences between protocols to provide a unified interface for
 applications.

Description: GLib Telepathy connection manager library (headers)
 This package contains development files for telepathy-glib, a GLib-based
 library for Telepathy connection managers.
 .
 telepathy-glib cannot yet be used to write Telepathy clients - use
 libtelepathy for that.
 .
 Some interfaces are not yet considered API- and ABI-stable. To
 use those interfaces in your connection manager, you'll also need
 the static library telepathy-glib-unstable, found in the Debian package
 libtelepathy-glib-unstable-dev.

Description: GLib Telepathy connection manager library (unstable interfaces)
 This package contains development files, including a static library, for
 interfaces not yet considered sufficiently API- and ABI-stable to go in
 the libtelepathy-glib shared library.
 .
 This currently means the ContactInfo, Forwarding, Privacy and Renaming
 connection interfaces; the ContactSearch channel type; and the Hold and
 Transfer channel interfaces. As these interfaces become stable, they may
 be moved into the shared library.
 .
 Due to the unstable nature of this library, Debian packages which
 Build-Depend on this library should only be uploaded to experimental.
